# sospice: Python data analysis tools for Solar Orbiter/SPICE

[SPICE](https://spice.ias.u-psud.fr/) is an extreme-UV imaging spectrometer on board the [Solar Orbiter](http://sci.esa.int/solar-orbiter/) mission.

`sospice` is intended to be a simple way of accessing all necessary functionalities required for day-to-day SPICE data analysis.
This package is in its early stages of development. Please see the [issues](https://github.com/solo-spice/sospice/issues) to see how you can contribute.

A generic SPICE data analysis user's manual (including Python and IDL tips) is available [on the IAS wiki](https://spice-wiki.ias.u-psud.fr/doku.php/data:data_analysis_manual).
